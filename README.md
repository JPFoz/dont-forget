# Don't Forget 

A small web app my wife and I use to remember things. 
Built with NextJs, backed by Firestore and deployed using Vercel. 
I also used it as an excuse with a proxy state library called [Valtio]( https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio).

You can switch modes by clicking the header.

Note: The code here allows open access to the firestore backend. If you want your data private consider adding authentication using [Firesbase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). Also make sure to lock down your Firestore using [security rules](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/security/rules-structure).
